# Security Controls Module Guide

## Overview

The Security Controls module provides a comprehensive assessment framework for organizations to evaluate their cybersecurity posture based on established industry standards. This module integrates NIST Cybersecurity Framework and Cyber Essentials controls with specific focus on NIS2 compliance requirements.

## Key Features

### 1. **Control Frameworks**

- **Cyber Essentials (UK NCSC)**: Essential cybersecurity controls for organizations
- **NIS2 Directive**: Specific controls required for NIS2 compliance
- **ISO 27001**: International information security standard

### 2. **Control Categories**
The module organizes controls into five main categories based on the NIST CSF:

- **üîç Identify**: Asset management, business environment, governance, risk assessment
- **üõ°Ô∏è Protect**: Access control, data security, maintenance, protective technology
- **üîç Detect**: Continuous monitoring, detection processes
- **üö® Respond**: Response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation
- **üîÑ Recover**: Recovery planning, improvements, communications

### 3. **Control Priorities**
- **üî¥ Mandatory**: Essential controls that must be implemented
- **üü° Recommended**: Important controls that should be implemented
- **‚ö™ Optional**: Additional controls for enhanced security

### 4. **NIS2 Compliance**
- Identifies which controls are mandatory for NIS2 Article 23 compliance
- Tracks implementation progress for NIS2 requirements
- Provides compliance scoring and recommendations

## Module Components

### SecurityControlsManager
Core management class that handles:
- Control definitions and metadata
- Organization assessments
- Data persistence (JSON files)
- Scoring calculations

### SecurityControlsInterface
Streamlit-based user interface with four main tabs:

#### üìä Controls Overview
- **Category-based organization**: View controls grouped by NIST CSF functions
- **Status indicators**: Visual representation of implementation status
- **Priority markers**: Clear identification of mandatory vs. recommended controls
- **NIS2 compliance**: Quick view of NIS2 requirement status

#### üîç Control Details
- **Framework filtering**: Filter controls by source framework
- **Category filtering**: Filter controls by NIST CSF category
- **Detailed information**: Full control descriptions, guidance, and criteria
- **Related controls**: See how controls interconnect

#### üìã Assessment Form
- **Status updates**: Change implementation status for any control
- **Responsibility assignment**: Assign responsible personnel
- **Documentation**: Add notes and evidence of implementation
- **Audit trail**: Track assessment history and changes

#### üìà Implementation Progress
- **Category progress**: Implementation status by NIST CSF function
- **Priority progress**: Implementation status by control priority
- **NIS2 compliance**: Specific progress on NIS2 requirements
- **Visual indicators**: Progress bars and status messages

## Default Controls

The module comes pre-populated with 15 essential controls:

### NIST CSF Controls
1. **ID-AM-1**: Asset Inventory Management (Mandatory, NIS2)
2. **ID-AM-2**: Business Environment Understanding (Recommended)
3. **PR-AC-1**: Access Control Management (Mandatory, NIS2)
4. **PR-AC-2**: Identity Management (Mandatory, NIS2)
5. **PR-DS-1**: Data Security (Mandatory, NIS2)
6. **DE-AE-1**: Security Monitoring (Mandatory, NIS2)
7. **DE-CM-1**: Continuous Monitoring (Recommended)
8. **RS-RP-1**: Incident Response Planning (Mandatory, NIS2)
9. **RS-CO-1**: Incident Communication (Mandatory, NIS2)
10. **RC-RP-1**: Recovery Planning (Mandatory, NIS2)

### Cyber Essentials Controls
1. **CE-1**: Secure Configuration (Mandatory, NIS2)
2. **CE-2**: Boundary Firewalls and Internet Gateways (Mandatory, NIS2)
3. **CE-3**: Access Control and Administrative Privilege Management (Mandatory, NIS2)
4. **CE-4**: Patch Management (Mandatory, NIS2)
5. **CE-5**: Malware Protection (Mandatory, NIS2)

## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Initial Setup**
- Navigate to the "üõ°Ô∏è Security Controls" tab
- The system automatically creates an assessment for your organization
- All controls start as "Not Implemented"

### 2. **Assessment Process**
1. **Review Controls**: Use the "Controls Overview" tab to understand requirements
2. **Assess Status**: Use the "Assessment Form" tab to update implementation status
3. **Document Evidence**: Add notes and evidence for each control
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor implementation progress in the "Implementation Progress" tab

### 3. **Implementation Guidance**
- Each control includes detailed implementation guidance
- Assessment criteria provide specific checkpoints
- Related controls show dependencies and connections

### 4. **Compliance Tracking**
- Overall implementation score (percentage)
- NIS2 compliance progress
- Category and priority breakdowns
- Next review dates and responsibilities

## Data Persistence

The module automatically saves all data to two JSON files:
- `security_controls.json`: Control definitions and metadata
- `organization_controls.json`: Organization-specific assessments

## Integration with NIS2

This module directly supports NIS2 Article 23 compliance by:
- Identifying mandatory controls for incident reporting
- Tracking implementation of required security measures
- Providing evidence for regulatory compliance
- Supporting incident response readiness

## Best Practices

### 1. **Regular Assessments**
- Conduct assessments quarterly or after significant changes
- Update status when controls are implemented
- Document evidence and responsible personnel

### 2. **Priority Implementation**
- Focus on mandatory controls first
- Implement NIS2 requirements early
- Use recommended controls to enhance security posture

### 3. **Documentation**
- Maintain detailed notes for each control
- Keep evidence of implementation
- Update responsible personnel assignments

### 4. **Continuous Improvement**
- Monitor progress regularly
- Identify gaps and prioritize implementation
- Use progress metrics to drive improvements

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
- **SecurityControl**: Individual control definition with metadata
- **OrganizationControlAssessment**: Organization's assessment of a specific control
- **OrganizationControls**: Complete organization assessment with scoring

### Scoring Algorithm
- **Fully Implemented**: 100% weight
- **Partially Implemented**: 50% weight
- **Not Implemented**: 0% weight
- **Not Applicable**: Excluded from scoring

### File Management
- Automatic creation of assessment files
- JSON serialization with Enum handling
- Error recovery and fallback to defaults

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Data Loading Errors**: System automatically falls back to default controls
2. **Missing Assessments**: New organizations automatically get assessments created
3. **Status Updates**: Ensure form submission is completed for changes to save

### Support
- Check the Streamlit console for error messages
- Verify file permissions for JSON data files
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Additional control frameworks (ISO 27001, COBIT, etc.)
- Risk-based prioritization
- Integration with GRC tools
- Automated compliance reporting
- Control effectiveness metrics
- Third-party assessment integration
